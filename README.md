# Project description
This repository contains my bachelor degree final project which was developed with professor L. Giaccone at Politecnico di Torino during fall-spring 2018. The goal of the thesis was the design and realization of a cheap and open source temperature and humidity data logger for indoor usage, followed by the development of a python code generating plots showing the behavior of the two quantities over time. 

Arduino UNO was used to manage the two sensors measurements writing them on a SD card so that the python script could be used to scan the entire content of the text file and create useful plots showing the behaviour over time of the two quantities.
